This is just how things are right now.  Things will make slightly more sense soon; but now, I am rushed.

There's a bunch of helpful scripts in the test/ directory.  Do everything from there, and you *should* be okay (although note the configure script is untested).

So:

First time:

cd test
./configure

(note it might make you install swig's build deps. please do so.)

Compiling:

cd test
./build

Using the built binaries to troll through testing.h:

cd test
./try-it

Files will appear.  ./clean to make them disappear.
